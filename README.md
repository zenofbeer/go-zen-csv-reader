# go-zen-csv-reader
I needed a script to format csv files and insert them into a database. This script
will read a csv, format the lines into a sql script and call inserts against the
targeted database. It's probably not much use as is for uses outside of mine,
but I'll see what I can do about making the script a little more generic.
